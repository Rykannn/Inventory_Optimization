## **Inventory Optimization**

**Project Description:**
This **Inventory Optimization** project is developed with the goal of optimizing the inventory management process in the F\&B (Food and Beverage) industry (e.g., restaurants, cafes). The project utilizes data from orders, inventory status, and forecasting factors (such as seasonality and demand predictions) to accurately calculate the amount of raw materials that need to be restocked, and to maximize the use of materials nearing expiration. This helps minimize stockouts and reduces raw material waste.

**Key Features of the System:**

1. **Demand Forecasting for Raw Materials:**

   * Based on order data and seasonal forecasts, the system can predict the required amount of raw materials to meet production needs.

2. **Calculating Materials to be Restocked:**

   * Based on the quantity of products sold and current inventory status, the system calculates the amount of raw materials needed for restocking.

3. **Utilizing Near-Expiry Materials:**

   * The system suggests dishes that can use materials nearing expiration, helping minimize waste.

4. **Integrating Seasonal and Order Demand Forecasts:**

   * The system handles seasonal fluctuations and predicts daily order demand, ensuring the inventory is sufficiently stocked without excess.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Python:** Used for data processing and analysis.
* **Pandas and NumPy:** Used for handling tabular data and calculating material requirements.
* **Machine Learning (optional):** Predictive models can be applied to more accurately forecast material needs.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Used for data visualization, helping managers easily track inventory status.

**Objective:**

* Minimize raw material waste in inventory.
* Ensure sufficient raw materials for dishes.
* Optimize inventory restocking and demand forecasting processes.

**Application:**

* This system is highly beneficial for restaurants, cafes, and F\&B businesses facing challenges in managing raw material inventories and predicting demand.
