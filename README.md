## **Inventory Optimization System**

**Project Description:**
This **Inventory Optimization** project provides a comprehensive solution for optimizing inventory management in the F&B (Food and Beverage) industry (e.g., restaurants, cafes). The system utilizes historical order data, current inventory status, and seasonal forecasting factors to accurately predict material requirements, calculate optimal restocking quantities, and maximize the utilization of materials nearing expiration. This helps minimize stockouts while reducing raw material waste.

## **✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE**

The system has been fully implemented and tested with the following components:

### **🚀 Quick Start**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the complete system
python main.py

# Run examples and tests
python examples.py
python -m unittest tests.test_inventory_optimizer
```

### **📊 Key Features Implemented:**

1. **✅ Demand Forecasting for Raw Materials:**

    - Seasonal adjustment factors (winter: +30%, weekend: +20%)
    - Historical trend analysis using order data
    - Configurable forecast periods (3-365 days)

2. **✅ Smart Restocking Calculations:**

    - Automatic calculation of material shortages
    - Cost-optimized reorder quantities
    - Minimum stock level maintenance

3. **✅ Near-Expiry Material Management:**

    - Identifies materials expiring within configurable thresholds
    - Suggests dishes that can utilize near-expiry materials
    - Calculates maximum servings possible with current stock

4. **✅ Seasonal & Demand Integration:**
    - Monthly seasonal factors
    - Weekend/weekday variations
    - Holiday adjustments

### **🛠️ Technologies Implemented:**

-   **Python 3.12+:** Core system development
-   **Pandas & NumPy:** Data processing and analysis
-   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Static visualizations and reports
-   **Plotly:** Interactive dashboards and charts
-   **Scikit-learn:** Ready for ML integration
-   **Unittest:** Comprehensive testing framework

### **📈 System Outputs:**

1. **Console Reports:** Real-time summary and recommendations
2. **CSV Exports:** Detailed data for external analysis
3. **Static Charts:** PNG files for presentations
4. **Interactive Dashboard:** HTML with dynamic charts
5. **Cost Analysis:** Investment requirements and ROI metrics

### **🎯 Objectives Achieved:**

-   ✅ Minimize raw material waste through expiry tracking
-   ✅ Ensure sufficient stock through demand forecasting
-   ✅ Optimize restocking with cost-benefit analysis
-   ✅ Provide actionable insights through visualizations

### **📋 Sample Results:**

```
OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
==================================================
Materials Requiring Restock: 2
Materials Near Expiry: 3
Total Restocking Cost: $875.19
Forecast Period: 7 days

RECOMMENDATIONS
🔴 URGENT: 2 materials need restocking
🟡 WARNING: 3 materials expire soon
```
